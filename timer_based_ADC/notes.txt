there are several prototype versions so far.

most advanced, "RA5_zeroed_display_20mhz" and intRC one 
can also use offset, stored in EEPROM nonvolatile memory!

RC5 should be pulled up weakly by some resistor (i.e. 10k) 
and as it is close to GND pin, no extra board space to set '0' 
is nessesary. one just needs to set desired voltage, and then short RA5 to ground, 
i.e. by inserting screwdriwer inbetween pins 4 and 5. 

then, microcontroller will set current ADC reading as offset, and will subtract it from each subsequent
reading. 

this way one can create i.e. battery state checker very easily, which will measure just 'interesting' part of the scale,
i.e. voltages 10-15V (ofc. using voltage divider!) for lead acid, or 3-4.2V for li-polymer.


note though that there is no code yet to handle under or over voltage, so displaying "sub zero" or above of scale values 
make display to roll over.  with use of intRC osc one gets additional 2 pins left i.e. for buzzer , charge control, or serial i/o.


note aswell that using intRC osc or xtal below 8mhz will make display flicker visibly. it's due to long 16bit conversion time.
with 20mhz xtal display is quite stable, and one can use almost 30mhz xtal if using voltage of 5 or 5.5V, "overclocking" pic.
